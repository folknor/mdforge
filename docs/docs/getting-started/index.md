# Introduction

mdforge converts Markdown files to beautifully styled PDFs. It's designed for creating professional documents like reports, papers, and documentation without leaving the comfort of Markdown.

## How It Works

mdforge uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to render HTML/CSS to PDF, giving you full control over styling with standard web technologies. Your Markdown is processed through [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) with extensions for features like syntax highlighting, footnotes, and smart typography.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Themes | Built-in themes or custom CSS |
| Fonts | Google Fonts with presets |
| Headers/Footers | Three-column layouts with variables |

## Origins

Originally forked from [simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf](https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf), mdforge has evolved with additional features like themes, font presets, icons, includes, and more.
